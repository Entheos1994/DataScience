Shred the remaining peel and pith, either by hand with a sharp knife or in a food processor (a food processor will give very fine flecks rather than strips of peel). Add the shredded peel and muslin bag to the pan along with the water. Leave to soak overnight. This helps to extract the maximum amount of pectin from the fruit pulp, which will give a better set.

Cook, uncovered, for 1\u00bd-2 hrs, until the peel has become very soft. (The cooking time will be affected by how thickly you have cut the peel.)
